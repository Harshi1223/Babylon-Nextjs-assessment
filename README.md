Babylon-Nextjs-assessment
ðŸ“Œ Summary

This is a simple Next.js application that provides login and registration features using Firebase Authentication. The project demonstrates user authentication flows, input validation, and basic navigation between login, registration, and home pages.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack Used

OS: Windows 11

Front-end Library: React (Next.js)

Programming Language: JavaScript

Runtime Environment: Node.js v22.17.1

IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio Code

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Backend / Authentication: Google Firebase

âœ… Pre-Requisites

To successfully run this project locally, you must have:

Node.js (and npm/yarn) â†’ Required to run the Next.js server, build the application, and manage dependencies.

VS Code (or equivalent IDE) â†’ Recommended for writing and managing source code with syntax highlighting, extensions, and integrated terminal.

Firebase Project â†’ You need to create a Firebase project and configure authentication (Email/Password).

ðŸš€ How to Run

Ensure Node.js and VS Code are installed.

Clone the project to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>
cd Babylon-Nextjs-assessment


Install dependencies:

npm install node-modules


Install Firebase SDK:

npm install firebase


Run the application:

npm run dev


Open the app in your browser:

http://localhost:3000/

âš¡ Challenges Faced

Environment Dependency & Security

The application relies on sensitive Firebase configuration (API keys, project IDs). These must be correctly set via environment variables to avoid build/runtime errors.

Single-File Complexity (Monolith)

For demonstration, login, register, and home components are kept close together. In real-world projects, code should be modularized for maintainability.

ðŸš€ Future Improvements

This project currently provides a working login and registration system using Next.js + Firebase Authentication.
Potential future improvements include:

ðŸ”¹ Authentication & Security

Persistent login (stay logged in after refresh).

Role-based access control (admin vs user).

Password reset functionality.

Email verification before login.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

ðŸ”¹ User Experience (UX/UI)

Modern UI with TailwindCSS / Material UI / Chakra UI.

Better validation with React Hook Form / Formik.

Loading states and spinners for login/register.

Toast notifications for errors/success messages.

Responsive design for all devices.

ðŸ”¹ Data Handling

Store extended user details in Firestore.

Profile page for updating user info.

Track login activity (last login, device, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ Deployment & DevOps

Deploy on Vercel.

Use environment variables for Firebase config.

Add CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.

ðŸ”¹ Scalability

Integrate social logins (Google, GitHub, Facebook).

Extend app with Firestore features (chat, posts, etc.).

Optimize Next.js SSR/ISR for performance.

ðŸ”¹ Testing & Code Quality

Add unit tests (Jest, React Testing Library).

Write integration tests for auth flows.

Use ESLint + Prettier for consistent code style.

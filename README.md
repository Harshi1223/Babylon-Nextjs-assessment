Babylon-Nextjs-assessment

ðŸ“Œ **Summary**

This is a simple Next.js application that provides login and registration features using Firebase Authentication. The project demonstrates user authentication flows, input validation, and basic navigation between login, registration, and home pages.

ðŸ›  **Tech Stack Used**

OS: Windows 11

Front-end Library: React (Next.js)

Programming Language: JavaScript

Runtime Environment: Node.js v22.17.1

IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio Code

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Backend / Authentication: Google Firebase

âœ… **Pre-Requisites**

To successfully run this project locally, you must have:

Node.js (and npm/yarn) â†’ Required to run the Next.js server, build the application, and manage dependencies.

VS Code (or equivalent IDE) â†’ Recommended for writing and managing source code with syntax highlighting, extensions, and integrated terminal.

Firebase Project â†’ You need to create a Firebase project and configure authentication (Email/Password).

ðŸš€ **How to Run**

Ensure Node.js and VS Code are installed.

Clone the project to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>
cd Babylon-Nextjs-assessment


Install dependencies:

``` npm install node-modules ```


Install Firebase SDK:

```npm install firebase```


Run the application:

```npm run dev```


Open the app in your browser:

```http://localhost:3000/```

âš¡ **Challenges Faced**

Environment Dependency & Security

The application relies on sensitive Firebase configuration (API keys, project IDs). These must be correctly set via environment variables to avoid build/runtime errors.


ðŸš€ **Future Improvements**

This project currently provides a working login and registration system using Next.js + Firebase Authentication.
Potential future improvements include:


Role-based access control (admin vs user).

Email verification before login.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

Better validation.

Responsive design for all devices.

Store extended user details in Firestore.

Track login activity (last login, device, etc.).

<h1>Babylon-Nextjs-assessment</h1>

<h2>📌Summary</h2>


This is a simple Next.js application that provides login and registration features using Firebase Authentication. The project demonstrates user authentication flows, input validation, and basic navigation between login, registration, and home pages.



<h2>🛠 Tech Stack Used</h2>

OS: Windows 11

Front-end Library: React (Next.js)

Programming Language: JavaScript

Runtime Environment: Node.js v22.17.1

IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio Code

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Backend / Authentication: Google Firebase


<h2>✅ Pre-Requisites</h2>



To successfully run this project locally, you must have:

Node.js (and npm/yarn) → Required to run the Next.js server, build the application, and manage dependencies.

VS Code (or equivalent IDE) → Recommended for writing and managing source code with syntax highlighting, extensions, and integrated terminal.

Firebase Project → You need to create a Firebase project and configure authentication (Email/Password).




<h2>🚀 How to Run</h2>


Ensure Node.js and VS Code are installed.

Clone the project to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>
cd Babylon-Nextjs-assessment


Install dependencies:

    npm install node-modules


Install Firebase SDK:

    npm install firebase


Run the application:

    npm run dev


Open the app in your browser:

    http://localhost:3000/

<h2>⚡ Challenges Faced</h2>



Environment Dependency & Security

The application relies on sensitive Firebase configuration (API keys, project IDs). These must be correctly set via environment variables to avoid build/runtime errors.



<h2>🚀 Future Improvements</h2>



This project currently provides a working login and registration system using Next.js + Firebase Authentication.
Potential future improvements include:


Role-based access control (admin vs user).

Email verification before login.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

Better validation.

Responsive design for all devices.

Store extended user details in Firestore.

Track login activity (last login, device, etc.).
